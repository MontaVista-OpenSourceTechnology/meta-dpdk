Pyro Release 5/2017
===================

Changed default kernel provider from linux-yocto to linux-intel.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Linux-intel is an Intel(R)-maintained kernel based on the latest stable
branch, along with backports from upstream to better support Intel(R)
hardware. The intel-linux kernel also has a branch with the preempt-rt
patches applied, providing a preempt-rt kernel with no additional work.

Added QEMU support.
-------------------
We now build several virtio drivers into the kernel by default, and
have qemuboot.conf files for intel-corei7-64 and intel-core2-32
targets. This allows one to do basic testing on meta-intel images
without having to use hardware. The virtio drivers are added via
KERNEL_FEATURES_INTEL_COMMON. This prevents them from being added to
custom kernels by default. They can be removed by adding the
following to a conf or kernel bbappend file:
  KERNEL_FEATURES_INTEL_COMMON_remove = “cfg/virtio.scc”
OVMF firmware is also built and can be used in order to emulate a UEFI
environment. A full runqemu command line for intel-corei7-64 could look
like this:
  runqemu core-image-minimal intel-corei7-64 wic ovmf

Musl support
------------
Meta-intel is now compatible with the musl C library. You can specify musl
As your C library by adding the following to your local.conf:
  TCLIBC = “musl”
Note: there is a known failure with DPDK.

X32 support
-----------
The meta-intel layer can now build with the x32 tune settings in a multi-lib
setting, it will not work in as the primary MACHINE tune as the bootloader needs
to be built as a 64bit binary. The setup for this would be as follows:
  require conf/multilib.conf
  MULTILIBS = "multilib:libx32
  DEFAULTTUNE_virtclass-multilib-libx32 = "corei7-64-x32"
